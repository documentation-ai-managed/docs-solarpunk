## What is Solarpunk?

Solarpunk empowers you to deploy agentic LLMs that think, act, and decide like your top performers. You map user interactions into repeatable actions while keeping data local on your device—no model training required. With stateful memory and LLM orchestration, you eliminate AI fatigue and ship faster.

Solarpunk runs local models alongside your API keys, ensuring privacy and control. Integrate it into your workflows to automate complex decisions without cloud dependencies.
